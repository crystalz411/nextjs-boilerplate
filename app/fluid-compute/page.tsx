        <h1>Hi Trevor 👋 – Let’s Talk Fluid Compute</h1>
        <p>
          Fluid Compute is a modern evolution of serverless — it removes the rigid concept of fixed infrastructure entirely.
        </p>
  
        <h2>🌀 What Is It?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional hosting or even serverless (which spins up functions per request), Fluid Compute treats your app like a living network of compute units that scale *intelligently* across functions, edge locations, and runtimes.
        </p>
  
        <h2>🧠 Why It Matters (Especially for AI)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>🚀 <strong>Faster Cold Starts:</strong> Optimized runtime placement reduces latency.</li>
          <li>🌍 <strong>Edge-Aware:</strong> Your AI API can respond in <em>milliseconds</em> globally.</li>
          <li>🔄 <strong>Integrated Workflows:</strong> Frontend, backend, and inference workloads can coexist fluidly.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>📣 For Your CTO</h2>
        <p>
          Vercel is evolving beyond static sites – it's enabling a responsive cloud architecture. Fluid Compute lets your teams deploy AI-driven personalization at speed, without worrying about ops overhead.
