        </p>
  
        <p>Hi Alex and Team,</p>
        <p>
          I hope you're doing well! I noticed your usage of Vercel has dropped recently, and I wanted to reach out to see how we can best support you going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Tanner’s departure, we completely understand how things may be shifting internally. If there are new goals, blockers, or transitions, I’d love to learn more so we can align Vercel’s support with your needs.
        </p>
  
        <p>To help us better support you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Would it help to review build errors and proxy configuration together?</li>
          <li>Are there any marketing campaigns or upcoming launches we should prepare for?</li>
          <li>Would an async technical audit be useful for the new dev team?</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          Let me know what works best for a short sync. I’m here to help make this transition as smooth as possible.
        </p>
  
        <p>Warm regards,<br />Crystal Yal<br />Customer Success</p>
