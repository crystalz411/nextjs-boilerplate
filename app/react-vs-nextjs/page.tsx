        <h1>React vs Next.js Explained</h1>
        <p>
          Great question! You’re probably hearing a lot about React and Next.js, so here’s a quick breakdown:
        </p>
  
        <h2>🔹 What is React?</h2>
        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Think of it as the “engine” behind your web app – it lets developers build components (like buttons, pages, forms), but it doesn’t say *how* to serve or optimize them.
        </p>
  
        <h2>🔹 What is Next.js?</h2>
        <p>
          Next.js is a framework built on top of React. It adds powerful features that help teams like yours ship high-performing, SEO-friendly sites more easily.
        </p>
  
        <h2>🌟 Why Next.js Helps Your Team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Built-in SEO:</strong> Pages are pre-rendered, which means search engines can read your content easily – improving rankings.</li>
          <li><strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> Next.js includes performance tooling out of the box to help you meet Google’s standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Next/Image automatically compresses and sizes images to keep your pages lightning-fast.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> You can monitor what matters (like conversion drops) using tools like Vercel Speed Insights.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          In short, React gives you the power to build. Next.js makes sure what you build performs well, ranks well, and converts well.
