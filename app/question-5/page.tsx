                Feedback on the Familiarization Exercise
              </h2>
              <p>
                I really really enjoyed the format of this exercise. I think i was 
                realistic, and gives a clear sense of what the Customer Success
                Manager role at Vercel might involve. The variety of scenarios
                really allows me to demonstrate both technical understanding and tailored
                communication.

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What i think is great</h2>

                  ðŸ“Œ The combination of technical tasks and customer-facing
                  communication reflects the real-world responsibilities of a
                  CSM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ðŸ“Œ The personas and job titles provided (like Christy - project manager, Trevor - full-stack senior
developer) helped me to tailor the tone and message to suit thier needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ðŸ“Œ The flexibility to use either the App Router or Pages
                  Router and the reduced focus on UI/UX design did help me with getting stuck in.
                  Although i cant help but to makes things look pretty ðŸ˜Š.

                  I think for the video task, providing an example or template
                  could help as a guide on what to do on this task. I took it as a presentation / demo style and hope that is ok.

              <p>
                Overall, this was one of the most engaging and well-balanced
                take-home exercises I've completed in a long time! Thank you for the
                opportunity! It gave me insight into your culture and how you
                value communication, curiosity, and clarity.
